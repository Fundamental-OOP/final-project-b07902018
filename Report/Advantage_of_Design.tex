\section{Advantage of Design}

1.	Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
    We achieve OCP in food ingredient, recipe, factory, static item, world.
    One can add any ingredient he/she by extending the Ingredient class by 
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{1.java}

One can creates any recipe by extending the abstract ConcreteRecipe class
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{2.java}

One can creates any ingredient factory by extending the abstract factory class
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{3.java}

One can creates any static item by extending the abstract StaticItem class public class
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{4.java}

Finally, One can also creates any static item by extending the abstract World class public class.

2. 沒有用到其他package, dependency很乾淨
